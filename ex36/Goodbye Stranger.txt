Goodbye Stranger
Supertramp
It was an early morning yesterday
I was up before the dawn
And i really have enjoyed my stay
But i must be moving on

Like a king without a castle
Like a queen without a throne
I´m an early morning lover
And i must be moving on

Now i believe in what you say
Is the undisputed truth
But i have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth

Like a ship without an anchor
Like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies
Sends a shiver through my veins

And i will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I´ll never look behind me
My troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger it´s been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true

Goodbye mary, goodbye jane
Will we ever meet again
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow feel no pain

Sweet devotion
It's not for me
Just give me motion
And set me free
And the land and the ocean
Far away
It's the life i've chosen
Every day
So goodbye mary, goodbye jane
Will we ever meet again (x2)

Now some they do and some they don´t
And some you just can´t tell
And some they will and some they won´t
With some it´s just as well

You can laugh at my behaviour
That´ll never bother me
Say the devil is my savior
But i don´t pay no heed

And i will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I´ll never look behind me
My troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger it´s been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true

Goodbye mary, goodbye jane
Will we ever meet again
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow feel no pain

Sweet devotion
It's not for me
Just give me motion
And set me free
And the Land and the Ocean
Far Away
It's the life I've chosen
Every Day
So now i'm leaving, got to go, hit the road
I'm saying once again
Oh yes i'm leaving, got to go, got to go
I'm sorry i must tell you
So goodbye mary, goodbye jane
Will we ever meet again (x2)

I believe, yes i've got to get away
