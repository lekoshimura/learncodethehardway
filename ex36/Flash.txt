Flash - Ah - Saviour of the universe 
Flash - Ah - He'll save ev'ry one of us 
Seemingly there is no reason for these 
Extraordinary intergalactical upsets (ha ha ha) 
What's happening Flash? 
Only Dr Hans Zarkov formerly at N A S A 
Has provided any explanation 
Flash - Ah - He's a miracle 
This mornings unprecedented solar eclipse 
Is no cause for alarm 
Flash - Ah - King of the impossible 
He's for ev'ry one of us 
Stand for ev'ry one of us 
He'll save with a mighty hand 
Ev'ry man ev'ry woman ev'ry child 
With a mighty Flash 
General Kaka Flash Gordon approaching 
What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching? 
Open fire all weapons 
Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body 
Flash - Ah 
Gordon's alive 
Flash - Ah - He'll save ev'ry one of us 
Just a man with a man's courage 
He knows nothing but a man 
But he can never fail 
No one but the pure in heart 
May find the golden grail oh oh oh oh 
Flash Flash I love you 
But we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth
