Dreamer - Supertramp

Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
I said dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
I said: "far out- what a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know - well you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot i can do

Dreamer, you stupid little dreamer,
So now you put your head in your hands, oh no!
I said "far out- what a day, a year, a laugh it is!"
Your know - well you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot i can do

Well work it out someday...

If i could see something
You can see anything you want, boy
If i could be someone -
You can be anyone, celebrate boy
If i could do something -
Well you can do something
If i could do anything -
Well can you do something out of this world?

Take a dream on a sunday
Take a life, take a holiday
Take a lie, take a dreamer
Dream dream dream dream dream along...

Dreamer, you know you are dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
I said dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, on no!
Oh no!
