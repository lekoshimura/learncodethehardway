Take The Long Way Home
Supertramp
So you think you're a Romeo
Playing a part in a picture-show
Take the long way home
Take the long way home

Cos you're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good
Take the long way home
Take the long way home

But there are times that you feel you're part of the scenery
All the greenery is comin' down, boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar, she used to be so nice

When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home

You never see what you want to see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

And when you're up on the stage, it's so unbelievable
Unforgettable, how they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity, is there no way out?

Althought you feel that you life's become a catastrophe
Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been
If you'd had more time

So, when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?
You took the long way home
You took the long way home
